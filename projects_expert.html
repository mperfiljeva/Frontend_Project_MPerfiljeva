            The project was part of the Career Foundry UX Design course. The goal of the project was to design a web app that would allow people to connect with an expert and pay for a video consultation.
          </p>
          <p>
            I worked on the project as a UX Design team of one and my tasks included:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>User research</li>
            <li>Wireframing and prototyping</li>
            <li>Usability testing</li>
            <li>Design documentation</li>

          <h3>Research</h3>
          <p>
            As a first step, I conducted a survey among the population matching my target demographics: 25 to 45 year old, gainfully employed people, who in the last 6 months looked an expert online. My goal was to explore trends, habits and pain
            points which I could examine closer in the interviews.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the user interviews I wanted to dive deeper into the information I have gathered in the survey. I have conducted five 30-minute interviews with people who have recently searched for an expert online and who matched my target
            demographics. After the interviews, I've used affinity mapping to analyse interview findings.

          <!--Description - Research2-->
          <p>
            Based on the information gathered from interviews, I have outlined the following points for my project:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide relevant search results that are not based on promotions or ads.</li>
            <li>Include a way for non-experts to find help, even if they don't know the right keywords.</li>
            <li>Allow users to comfortably read and analyse reviews.</li>
            <li>Aim for quality rather than quantity of results, as users feel relieved when they have limited choices.</li>
            <li>Have a way to communicate and build a relationship with an expert before committing to a paid service.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that users don't know how experts work or what they need.</li>
            <li>Aim for clarity and trust by clearly communicating response times, prices and other relevant information.</li>
          </ul>

          <!--Description - Ideation-->
          <h3>Ideation</h3>
          <p>
            Based on research findings, I've created personas that represented my users:
            <ul>
              <li><b>Akari:</b> a confident user who knows what service and expert she needs. She looks for an expert to make sure her problem is resolved with the best possible outcome. However, Akari is frustrated by the amount of irrelevant
                information and advertising that she receives when conducting her research.</li>
              <li><b>Boris:</b> a non-native speaker who has a question, but doesn't know which exactly expert could answer it. Boris feels unable to choose the exact words to find what he needs. He is frustrated by the lack of information available
                on
                the experts' websites when it comes to their services and prices.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, I created user journeys to visualise an ideal interaction between each persona and the future web app. My goal at this stage was to transform the research findings into product development ideas that could be further refined
            and which would guide the design
          </p>

          <!--Description - Prototype-->
          <h3>Prototype</h3>
          <p>
            Based on the ideas outlined, I started sketching out the screens for the "Expert". Working iteratively from pencil sketches and low-fidelity wireframes in Balsamiq, I've created a high-fidelity grayscale prototype in Figma for the mobile
            view. The prototype covered the essential user tasks such as searching for and booking an expert.

          <!--Description - Usability testing-->
          <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
          <p>
            With the prototype ready, it was time to put it for a test. My goal was to observe and evaluate how new users would engage with the “Expert” and complete essential tasks: finding an expert, booking a paid service and navigating their
            dashboard.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the usability testing, I recruited 7 participants who matched my personas and target demographics. I conducted 30 to 45 minute usability tests using a mix of in-person and remote sessions. The sessions included practical scenarios and
            open-ended questions (test script and tasks can be seen here). Test outcomes were analysed using the rainbow spreadsheet and compiled into a test report.

          <h3>Design</h3>
          <p>
            To ensure that my UI elements looked and acted the same way everywhere, I conducted a brief UI inventory of my prototype and outlined my and design system. I outlined the look, feel, and behavior of elements such as cards, buttons and
            navigation items as well as documented accessibility principles which I followed in the design.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          This project was a great learning journey for me. As I come from an instructional design background, I found a lot of overlaps between my old discipline and UX, in particular the focus on finding the best solution to a problem identified in
          the research and the importance of feedback and iterative development.
